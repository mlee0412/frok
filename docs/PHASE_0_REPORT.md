# Phase 0 â€” UI System Initialization & Structure Review

- **status**: verified
- **date**: 2025-10-20

## Summary
- **Objective**: Establish unified design system before dashboards/chat.
- **Scope**: `packages/ui`, `apps/ui-docs`, Tailwind v4 wiring, tokens.

## Deliverables Checklist
- [x] `packages/ui` created with primitives: `Button`, `Card`, `Tabs`, `Input`, `AppShell`, `SideNav`
- [x] `styles/tokens.css` with dark-neon tokens
- [x] `apps/ui-docs` Storybook app (Vite)
- [x] `apps/web` consumes tokens and scans `@frok/ui` in Tailwind
- [x] Accessibility: focus rings (Button/Input/SideNav links), contrast, reduced motion
- [x] Theme compatibility verified with `apps/web` (next-themes wired)

## Notes
- Keep design tokens centralized. No inline color overrides in app code.
- Every new UI element should include a Storybook story in `apps/ui-docs`.

## Blockers / Risks
- None identified yet.

## Next Steps
- Start Phase 1 refacing using `@frok/ui` primitives.
