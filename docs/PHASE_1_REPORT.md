# Phase 1 — Dashboard Refacing & Navigation Consolidation

Date: 2025-10-23
Status: Completed (with minor follow-ups)

## Summary
- Implemented a unified AppShell and SideNav across the dashboard segment using `@frok/ui` primitives.
- Converted core UI to design-token-driven styles (Tailwind v4 tokens), reducing hardcoded palette usage.
- Added collapsible behavior to SideNav with accessible toggle.
- Wired React Query provider at the app root for data-driven pages.
- Verified pages for Profile, System (tabs), Smart Home, Health, Development, Automation, Finances, and Users are present and using `@frok/ui` components.
- Storybook updated to include a `Toaster` story (with variants) under `apps/ui-docs`.

## What Shipped
- `packages/ui` primitives: `Button`, `Card`, `Tabs`, `Input`, `AppShell`, `SideNav`, `Toaster`.
- Design tokens: `packages/ui/styles/tokens.css` extended with `--color-surface` and `--color-border`, mapped via `@theme inline` to `bg-surface`, `border-border`, etc.
- Token adoption in UI components and app:
  - `Card`, `Button`, `Tabs`, `SideNav`, `AppShell` refactored to token-based classes.
  - `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/Breadcrumbs.tsx` and `profile/page.tsx` updated to tokens.
- Collapsible SideNav (keyboard-accessible) toggled from `DashboardNav`.
- React Query provider implemented in `apps/web/src/providers/QueryProvider.tsx`.
- Storybook: `apps/ui-docs/src/stories/Toaster.stories.tsx` added.

## Verification Checklist
- Tokens imported globally in `apps/web/src/styles/globals.css` and Tailwind v4 in use.
- `@frok/ui` exports consumed by web app without build errors.
- Dashboard routes render under `AppShell` with SideNav and Breadcrumbs.
- System tabs update URL query and content without full page reload.
- Collapsible SideNav toggles width and maintains focus/ARIA state.
- Toaster renders notifications via `useToast()` in Storybook and app layout.

## Gaps/Follow-ups
- Continue tokenizing remaining pages to remove residual palette classes (e.g., status colors in `dashboard/page.tsx`). Consider adding semantic `--color-success`/`--color-danger` tokens.
- Add keyboard navigation enhancements for `Tabs` (Left/Right arrows) if needed.
- Optional: centralize Tailwind config in `packages/config` later.

## Environment & Config
- Verified `.env.local` is present at `apps/web/.env.local` with Supabase and integration keys.
- Next step for Phase 2: add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the same file (server-side usage only).

## Ready for Phase 2 — Next Steps
- Add `openai` SDK and create streaming chat API at `apps/web/src/app/api/chat/route.ts`.
- Build chat UI primitives in `@frok/ui` (ChatMessage, ChatInput, ChatSidebar, ThreadHeader) and add stories.
- Replace `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` with chat interface, leaving `/dashboard` intact.
- Add client Supabase util and Realtime channel subscription for thread/message updates.
- Implement multi-agent selector and session state via Zustand.
