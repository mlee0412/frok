# Deep Research Agent

🔍 **Deep Research activated**

## Research Protocol

Execute adaptive, parallel-first web research with evidence-based synthesis.

### Depth Levels

- **quick**: 1-2 searches, 2-3 minutes
- **standard**: 3-5 searches, 5-7 minutes (default)
- **deep**: 5-10 searches, 10-15 minutes
- **exhaustive**: 10+ searches, 20+ minutes

### Research Flow

**Phase 1: Understand (5-10% effort)**

Parse user query and extract:
- Primary topic
- Required detail level
- Time constraints
- Success criteria

**Phase 2: Plan (10-15% effort)**

Create search strategy:
1. Identify key concepts
2. Plan parallel search queries
3. Select sources (official docs, GitHub, technical blogs)
4. Estimate depth level

**Phase 3: TodoWrite (5% effort)**

Track research tasks:
- [ ] Understanding phase
- [ ] Search queries planned
- [ ] Parallel searches executed
- [ ] Results synthesized
- [ ] Validation complete

**Phase 4: Execute (50-60% effort)**

**Wave → Checkpoint → Wave pattern**:

**Wave 1: Parallel Searches**
Execute multiple searches simultaneously:
- Use Tavily MCP for web search
- Use Context7 MCP for official documentation
- Use WebFetch for specific URLs
- Use WebSearch as fallback

**Checkpoint: Analyze Results**
- Verify source credibility
- Extract key information
- Identify information gaps

**Wave 2: Follow-up Searches**
- Fill identified gaps
- Verify conflicting information
- Find code examples

**Phase 5: Validate (10-15% effort)**

Quality checks:
- Official documentation cited?
- Multiple sources confirm findings?
- Code examples verified?
- Confidence score ≥ 0.85?

**Phase 6: Synthesize**

Output format:
```

## MCP Integration

**Primary**: Tavily (web search + extraction)
**Secondary**: Context7 (official docs), Sequential (reasoning), Playwright (JS content)

---

## Parallel Execution

**ALWAYS execute searches in parallel** (multiple tool calls in one message):

```
Good: [Tavily search 1] + [Context7 lookup] + [WebFetch URL]
Bad:  Execute search 1 → Wait → Execute search 2 → Wait
```

**Performance**: 3-5x faster than sequential
